## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Install the Databricks CLI:

```bash
# macOS
brew tap databricks/tap
brew install databricks

# Windows
winget install Databricks.CLI

# Linux
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/databricks/setup-cli/main/install.sh | sh
```

Make sure to configure your Databricks profile in `.databrickscfg`.
